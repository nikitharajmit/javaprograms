Interfaces
----------

<access modifier> interface <interface name>
{
Function declarations;
<return type> <function name>(<argument list>);
}

Interfaces are implemented through classes.
Interfaces are defined to insist the classes to define the definition of the methods declared in it.

Implementation
--------------
<access modifier> class <class name> implements <interface names...>(more than 1 interfacses can be implemented)


interface KEBRules
{
void installEnergyMeter();
}

interface MUDARules
{
void leaveSetBacks(int distanceInFeetEW,int distanceInFeetNS);
}

class HouseConstruction implements KEBRules, MUDARules
{
    public void installEnergyMeter()
    {
        System.out.println("Energy meter is installed");
    }

    public void leaveSetBacks(int distanceInFeetEW,int distanceInFeetNS)
    {
        System.out.println("Set backs are taken care");
    }
}

Interfaces can be instantiated as reference objects
---------------------------------------------------

<interface name> <interface ref/obj name>;

// Assume a transcation in a library where the issue and return are the key process. Each process has its own existance and also available for Librarian and Student

Class

Interface
----------
1. Collection of Abstract Methods
2. Collection of Final Variables - Constant values
3. Default methods - Method defined in Interface with default keyword
4. Static methods

// Exceptions
Throwable
    - Exception - Can be handled through code blocks
    - Error - Cannot be handled through code blocks

Exception
- User defined exceptions
- Pre-defined exceptions


Exception Blocks - Exception handlers

try
    {
    ---

    Code which might through Exceptions
    }

Inheritance of Exception
------------------------

Exception - Base class for all Exceptions in JAVA

User defined Exception
----------------------
<access modifier> class <class name> extends Exception
{

// Constructor
<access modifier> <class name>(String str)
{
super(str);
-
-
-
-
}


}

throw -  this is a keyword which is used to alert an Exception object to the calling function/class

throw <Exception class object>;

Exception will be thrown in a statement which is defined in a function

Function should be explicitly indicated that it is throwing an Exception

<access modifier> <return type> <function name>(<argument list>) throws <ExceptionClassName which will be thrown from this function>
{
-
-
-
-
throw <ExceptionClassObject>
}

toString() is a method which is used to show

// Exception Chaining and Multiple Exception catch block

Bank
- Avg Monthly min Bal = 5000
- Fine for not maintaining AVG Balance=200

Current Balance = 5100
    Withdraw=2000
    Withdraw=3000
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    1 month over
    Withdraw=100;
        - AVGMonthlyBalanceNotMaintainedError
        - InsufficientBalance

        due to non avg balance balance will be -100 after fine
            Throw InsufficientBalanceError

1 functions used for Exception Chaining

1. initCause(<Exception Object>)
2. getCause();


Multiple Exception Catch Block

try
{
.
.
.
.
}
catch(<Exception1> | <Exception2> | <Exception3>)
{
.
.
.
}

e.g.

Login
-----
    Username
    Password
        validate Username and Password
            if Invalid
                   Username?? -> Username is invalid - InvalidUserNameException
                   Password?? -> Password is invalid - InvalidPasswordException
                   Both?? -> Username and Password is invalid


try
{
    //username validation??
}
catch(InvalidUserNameException | InvalidPasswordException ex)
{
    // Invalid Username/Password
}


// Assignment

Assume a scenario in eCommerce where the below operations are supported
a. Product creation with Supplier details
b. Product Grouping under category name
c. User registration
d. Product purchase
e. Product discounts - Promotional offer based on the DiscountCode

// Packages
folder name should be same as packagename

each class file name should have 1st statement as package

package <packagename>;

in case of subfolders, folder name w.r.t packages are represented using "." separator
